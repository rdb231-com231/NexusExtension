# Nexus README

**Nexus** is a programming language created in Brazil. It is a *simple* programming language with not much access to features such as `classes`.<br>
The language was created as a project to *"test"* my skills (as MewPlush) and learn something that I wanted to do **since** I learned programming, if you have any **issues**, contact me using those enabled [contacts](#contacts).
Check **more** on [Github](https://github.com/rdb231-com231/Nexus-Lang/tree/GEN2_tests)
